The dashboard dynamically visualizes key metrics and trends. It likely includes:

Slicers: For filtering data by attributes such as gender, purchase status, or region.

Charts: Visual summaries linked to the pivot table.

Formulas: Utilizes Excel backend logic like:
# GETPIVOTDATA("Income", PivotTable!$A$1, "Gender", "Female")

# Common Formulas

Income Bracket:

=IF(Income < 50000, "Low", IF(Income < 100000, "Medium", "High"))

# Age Group Categorization:
